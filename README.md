# iridium-snippets package

This package provides snippets that can be used when writing Cucumber test scripts
with the (Iridium)[https://github.com/AutoGeneral/IridiumApplicationTesting] testing application.

Note that the snippets are not exhaustive, but are designed to provide the
most common steps that you'll use when testing a web application.
