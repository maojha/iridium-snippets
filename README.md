# iridium-snippets package

This package provides snippets that can be used when writing Cucumber test scripts
with the (Iridium)[https://github.com/AutoGeneral/IridiumApplicationTesting] testing application.

Note that the snippets are not exhaustive, but are designed to provide the
most common steps that you'll use when testing a web application.

The following prefixes trigger a list of snippets:

* click
* save
* select
* mouse
* open
* populate
* wait
